# Education-Perfect-Completer
Completes ALMOST all education perfect questions in standard education perfect tasks, with near perfect accuracy!



# How it works
EP completer is in the format of a chrome extension that injects code into education perfect tabs. It then requests the task information and answers from the education perfect servers. It uses this task data to skip information slides, automatically answers multiple choice questions and fill out long answer questions with placeholder text, adding question keywords at the end.

EP completer may struggle with questions that have similar answers such as with maths, and may have trouble answering in languages other than english (particularly arabic)

EP completer has support for the majority of question types, but there are at least 2 known question types (less common ones) it does not support YET.
