<h3>Alt + S: Start/Stop the autocompleter</h3>
<h3>Currently supports 5 different types of question and can recognise and ignore 3 more! </h3>
<h3>Sometimes the autocompleter may get itself into a loop and get stuck, due to the poor and hard to reverse engineer design of education perfect. It is best, in these cases, to turn it off using <strong>Alt + S</strong> and answer the question yourself.</h3>
